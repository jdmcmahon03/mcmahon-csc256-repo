# Welcome to My Repository

This repository is for my CSC256 coursework. Here I will keep all assignments, projects, and notes organized throughout the semester for this specific class only. 

## About Me

I am currently finishing my second degree at Wake Tech in Computer Programming and Development. I'm excited to learn more about GitHub in this course as it's an important and helpful tool!

## Course Goals?

Throughout CSC256, I will create multiple projects and store them here. Each project will have its own folder, and all code will be properly documented to help me review later but also make changes when need be. Keeping everything organized will allow me to smoothly get my assignments done and have a safe place to store my code in case something ever happens.
