## AI's Impact on Automobile Software
  One of the many reasons as why car price's have continued to rise over the last several years is due to new open source technology that is being implemented into vehicles. These open source driving systems can be saftey features, leisure related, or just basic car features such as navigation tools. In the article, *A Survey of Open-Source Autonomus Driving Systems and Their Impact on Research,* Aliane (2025), explains how AI and open source platforms are changing the car industry rapidly. According to the survey, systems such as Apollo, NVIDIA Drive, and OpenPilot have allowed better collababoration and are accelerating the technology features in our cars a lot more faster. They use AI to help with rapid decision making such as lane assistance, reccognizing pedestrians and traffic signs real time such as Tesla's. AI supports improvements in not only software qulaity but cubersecurity as the more technology features are being placed in our vehicles. It also helps identify software bugs and when companies such as Google or Apple use AI for the navigational apps, the car and navigation software's work hand and hand together in provding you real time updates. The survey really highlights that the integration of AI with open-source autonomous driving systems is paving the way toward “safer, smarter, and more reliable” transportation solutions as more vehicles are being driven on our roads daily as the population rises.

## Shifting roles in software development
  In the article *How AI Coding is Transforming the IT Industry in 2025*, ITPro tries to paint the perspective of artificial intelligence is not eliminating the role of softare developers but rather changing their workload and what skills they need to be a software developer. ITPro mentions that tools such as AI code assistants are being used by the majority of development teams which might seem like a bad thing but in reality it allows developers to spend less time on repetitive coding tasks and instead they can focus on debugging, building system architecture, or reviewing AI generated code. In a way, this is changing software developers roles as being "code writers to becoming curators" according to the article. The article highlights that AI is capable of generating entire code blocks and being able to help common programming errors however software developers are still needed to correct AI as it can always make mistakes just like human error can. Due to this, software developers are very much still important and needed to make sure code is optimized properly, secure, and correct. Software developers don't only need programming knowledge now, they also need to be able to evaluate AI models and possibly engineer the model themselves which the article highlights very well by stating “the developer of the future will need to master prompting, governance, and system integration as much as coding itself” (ITPro, 2025). This perspective that ITPro points out, shows that AI is not making human developers go away but is jut shifting their role into something that might involve more critical thinking and oversight. 

## AI’s Impact on Software Quality Assurance
  In the article *The AI Revolution in Software Testing and Quality Assurance*, a report is presented by Shift Asia that states, "AI-powered testing tools can automatically update scripts when applications change, reducing test maintenance costs by as much as 25%” (SHIFT ASIA, 2024). I think this is a prime example on how AI can maybe take or change QA roles that people work in. For example in the gaming industry, QA jobs are highly important to find bugs and errors before they ship out a large title which is a software. This is an important job that companies do pay for at a decent price depending on the area and studio, and if AI can reduce costs by 25% they might be more incline to try and implement a system where AI can write scripts to fix bugs quickly while programmers can work on other tasks. Shift Asia makes it important to explain however that “while AI can handle repetitive testing and anomaly detection, human testers remain indispensable for designing meaningful scenarios and validating real-world performance” (SHIFT ASIA, 2024). In a game development sense, this means AI could check issues for things like main menus, collision, bugs, while a QA tester can focus on testing the actual gameplay which is something AI couldn't judge as well as a human for example. 

## Future Trends
From a human mindset, I think AI has its good and bad. We will continue to see the rapid growth of AI and how much it'll improve over the years. As stated earlier, we are seeing it more and more in our vehicles but this also includes are daily life such as phone apps, certain work jobs, websites, programming, etc. AI will soon be able to write full codes with likely minimal human input as it continues to learn. IBM does a great job at mentioning some of the negatives that come with AI such as Deepfakes and misinformation being on the rise stating. "Gen AI has made it easier to create deepfakes—realistic but fake audio, video and images—used to spread false information and manipulate public opinion. This poses challenges for information integrity and media trust. Addressing this requires advanced detection tools, public education and possibly legal measures to hold creators of malicious deepfakes accountable" (IBM 2024). This brings me to my final point that I think software engineers and QA testers will shift more to an AI supervision and almost governance like role while fixing the errors it may cause. AI can be a useful too, but it's important that we don't become to dependent on it.
